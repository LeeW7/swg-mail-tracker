# GitHub Releases Guide

This guide explains how to create releases on GitHub to distribute your executable to end users.

## üì¶ What Are GitHub Releases?

GitHub Releases allow you to:
- Distribute compiled binaries (like `.exe` files)
- Version your software
- Provide release notes and changelogs
- Let users download without needing to build from source

**Users will download from:** `https://github.com/LeeW7/swg-mail-tracker/releases`

## üî® Step 1: Build the Executable on Windows

### Prerequisites
1. Access to a Windows machine (Windows 10 or 11)
2. Python 3.10+ installed
3. Poetry installed

### Build Process

```cmd
# Clone the repository (if not already)
git clone https://github.com/LeeW7/swg-mail-tracker.git
cd swg-mail-tracker

# Run the build script
build\build.bat
```

This creates: `dist\SWGMailTracker.exe` (~25-35 MB)

### Test the Executable

**Important:** Test before releasing!

1. Copy `SWGMailTracker.exe` to a different folder
2. Double-click to run
3. Verify all features work:

```

Add to release notes:
```
### Checksums
