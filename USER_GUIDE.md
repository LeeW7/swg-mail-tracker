# SWG Mail Tracker - User Guide

**Automatically sync your Star Wars Galaxies in-game mail to swgtracker.com**

---

## üì• Installation

### Download the Application

1. Go to the [**Releases page**](https://github.com/LeeW7/swg-mail-tracker/releases)
2. Download the latest **`SWGMailTracker.exe`**
3. Save it anywhere on your computer (Desktop, Documents, etc.)

**That's it!** No installation required. No Python. No dependencies.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Defender / SmartScreen Warning

**This is completely normal and expected!** Since this application is not digitally signed with a paid certificate, Windows will show security warnings.

#### When Downloading (Browser Warning)

**Microsoft Edge / Chrome:**
1. Your browser may block the download with a warning
2. Click on the **three dots (...)** or **"Show more"**
3. Click **"Keep"** or **"Keep anyway"**

**Why this happens:** Unsigned .exe files trigger browser protection. This is a false positive - the app is safe.

#### When Running (Windows Defender SmartScreen)

**First-time launch warning:**

When you double-click `SWGMailTracker.exe`, Windows may show:

```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.
```

**To run the application:**

1. Click **"More info"** (small blue text)
2. Click **"Run anyway"** button
3. The app will start normally

**Alternative method - Unblock the file:**

1. Right-click on `SWGMailTracker.exe`
2. Select **Properties**
3. At the bottom, check the box: **‚òëÔ∏è Unblock**
4. Click **Apply** ‚Üí **OK**
5. Now double-click to run normally

#### Windows Defender Antivirus Alert

If Windows Defender flags the file:

1. Open **Windows Security** (search in Start menu)
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**
3. Click **Protection history**
4. Find the `SWGMailTracker.exe` alert
5. Click **Actions** ‚Üí **Allow**

**Or add an exclusion:**

1. Open **Windows Security**
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**
3. Click **Manage settings** (under "Virus & threat protection settings")
4. Scroll down to **Exclusions**
5. Click **Add or remove exclusions**
6. Click **Add an exclusion** ‚Üí **File**
7. Browse to and select `SWGMailTracker.exe`

#### Why Does This Happen?

This application is built with PyInstaller, which packages Python applications into executables. Windows flags unsigned executables from unknown publishers as a security precaution.

**This is a false positive.** The application:
- ‚úÖ Is open source (you can view all code on GitHub)
- ‚úÖ Only connects to swgtracker.com
- ‚úÖ Only reads your SWG mail files
- ‚úÖ Stores settings locally in config.json
- ‚úÖ Does not collect or send any personal data

**Why not sign it?** Code signing certificates cost $100-400/year from trusted authorities. This is a free, community tool.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Mail path does not exist"

**Solution:**
- Double-check your SWG installation path
- Make sure you're pointing to the `mail_CharacterName` folder, not just `mail`
- The folder must exist (created after receiving at least one in-game mail)

### "Connection test failed"

**Solutions:**
- Verify you're connected to the internet
- Check that swgtracker.com is accessible
- Confirm your User ID and API Key are correct (no extra spaces)
- Make sure your swgtracker.com account is active

### "Files detected but not uploading"

**Solutions:**
- Check the Activity Log for specific error messages
- Verify your API credentials are still valid
- Make sure the mail files aren't empty
- Check `swg_mail_tracker.log` for detailed errors

### Application won't start

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you downloaded the correct file (`SWGMailTracker.exe`)
- Check Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking it
- Try running as Administrator (right-click ‚Üí Run as administrator)
- Redownload the file (it might be corrupted)

### "How do I uninstall?"

Simply delete the `SWGMailTracker.exe` file and the `config.json` file (created in the same folder).

---

## üìÅ Configuration File

The app creates a `config.json` file in the same folder as the .exe.

**This file stores your settings:**
- Mail directory path
- API credentials
- Preferences

**Backup tip:** Save a copy of `config.json` to quickly restore your settings on another computer.

---

## üîí Privacy & Security

- Your API credentials are stored locally in `config.json`
- Mail content is sent directly to swgtracker.com (HTTPS)
- No data is collected or sent anywhere else
- The application runs entirely on your computer

---

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Start SWG Mail Tracker before launching the game**
2. **Click "Start Monitoring"**
3. **Minimize to system tray** (keeps it out of the way)
4. **Play SWG normally** - mail is synced automatically
5. **Stop monitoring when done** (or leave it running!)

### Multiple Characters

The app now supports **up to 4 characters simultaneously**!

1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Click **"+ Add Character"** to add more mail folders
3. Enter an optional label for each character (e.g., "Main", "Alt", "Trader")
4. Browse to each character's mail folder
5. Click **Save Settings**
6. Start monitoring - all folders will be watched at once!

**No need to stop/start or run multiple instances!** The app monitors all configured folders simultaneously.

### Always Running

Want mail to sync 24/7?

1. Enable **"Auto-start monitoring"** in Settings
2. Create a Windows shortcut to the .exe
3. Place shortcut in `shell:startup` folder (press Win+R, type `shell:startup`)
4. App will launch automatically when Windows starts
