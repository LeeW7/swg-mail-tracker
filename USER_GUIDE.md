## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Mail path does not exist"

**Solution:**
- Double-check your SWG installation path
- Make sure you're pointing to the `mail_CharacterName` folder, not just `mail`
- The folder must exist (created after receiving at least one in-game mail)

### "Connection test failed"

**Solutions:**
- Verify you're connected to the internet
- Check that swgtracker.com is accessible
- Confirm your User ID and API Key are correct (no extra spaces)
- Make sure your swgtracker.com account is active

### "Files detected but not uploading"

**Solutions:**
- Check the Activity Log for specific error messages
- Verify your API credentials are still valid
- Make sure the mail files aren't empty
- Check `swg_mail_tracker.log` for detailed errors

### Application won't start

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you downloaded the correct file (`SWGMailTracker.exe`)
- Check Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking it
- Try running as Administrator (right-click ‚Üí Run as administrator)
- Redownload the file (it might be corrupted)

### "How do I uninstall?"

Simply delete the `SWGMailTracker.exe` file and the `config.json` file (created in the same folder).

---

## üìÅ Configuration File

The app creates a `config.json` file in the same folder as the .exe.

**This file stores your settings:**
- Mail directory path
- API credentials
- Preferences

**Backup tip:** Save a copy of `config.json` to quickly restore your settings on another computer.

---

## üîí Privacy & Security

- Your API credentials are stored locally in `config.json`
- Mail content is sent directly to swgtracker.com (HTTPS)
- No data is collected or sent anywhere else
- The application runs entirely on your computer

---

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Start SWG Mail Tracker before launching the game**
2. **Click "Start Monitoring"**
3. **Minimize to system tray** (keeps it out of the way)
4. **Play SWG normally** - mail is synced automatically
5. **Stop monitoring when done** (or leave it running!)

### Multiple Characters

If you play multiple characters:

1. Stop monitoring
2. Go to Settings
3. Browse to the different character's mail folder
4. Save settings
5. Start monitoring again

**Or:** Run multiple instances of the app (one per character), just copy the .exe to different folders.

### Always Running

Want mail to sync 24/7?

1. Enable **"Auto-start monitoring"** in Settings
2. Create a Windows shortcut to the .exe
3. Place shortcut in `shell:startup` folder (press Win+R, type `shell:startup`)
4. App will launch automatically when Windows starts
